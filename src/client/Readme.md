# Graffy Client

This built-in module provides a client library for applications that run on the browser. It uses the `fetch()` and `EventStream` APIs, and requires these to be polyfilled by your application if you wish to support Internet Explorer.

Graffy Client is intended to be used with a Node.js server running Graffy Server, but should work with any server implementing the [Graffy/HTTP protocol](https://aravindet.github.io/graffy/#/Protocol).

See [Graffy documentation](https://aravindet.github.io/graffy/#/GraffyClient) for more.
